# Sarrus-determinant-3x3
This c++ program can calculate the Sarrus determinant 3x3 and provide results for D, D1, D2, D3 and for x, y and z. It also supports a complex numbers. 
If you want to calculate just real parts number, you need to put 0 on input. For example if you want to input 4, you need to type in the terminal: 4 0. Same for an imaginary parts: 0 4 (i4).
There is also a special program written only for real numbers, called determinant-real.
